#Create a Hash File for Each Password In your home directory, create individual files for each hash

echo "insert_hash" > hash1.txt
echo "insert_hash" > hash2.txt
echo "insert_hash" > hash3.txt

#Run Hashcat for Each Hash and Use Hashcat to crack each hash one at a time. 
# For MD5 hashes, specify hash type -m 0 and the RockYou wordlist.

hashcat -m 0 -a 0 -o cracked1.txt hash1.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
hashcat -m 0 -a 0 -o cracked2.txt hash2.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
hashcat -m 0 -a 0 -o cracked3.txt hash3.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt

#Check the Results - After each command completes, view the output file to see the cracked password:

cat cracked1.txt
cat cracked2.txt
cat cracked3.txt

#Each cat command will display the cracked password for its respective hash if found. 
#This approach will ensure each password is tested individually.
